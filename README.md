# Biased Coin Toss — A Bayesian Perspective

This project is a hands-on exploration of a classic probability scenario: analyzing a biased coin flip. Beyond its simplicity, this exercise demonstrates key statistical tools that build a foundation for more advanced quantitative analysis and decision-making under uncertainty.

## 📂 Files

- `Biased Coin Toss.ipynb` — Interactive Jupyter Notebook with complete code, explanations, and visualizations.
- `README.md` — This overview.

## 📊 Concepts Covered

Through this notebook, I practice and demonstrate:

✅ Simulating biased coin flips  
✅ Applying Bayesian inference to update beliefs in real-time  
✅ Constructing credible intervals  
✅ Using Monte Carlo simulation for uncertainty estimation  
✅ Implementing sequential analysis for evidence-based stopping rules

These techniques reflect core skills in probabilistic modeling, which are directly relevant in areas such as quantitative trading, algorithmic decision systems, and real-time risk management.
